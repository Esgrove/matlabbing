**Various MATLAB scripts I have created over the years.**               



### Sobol Hemisphere (sobol_hemisphere.m)

Checking how [Sobol sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobol_sequence) samples map to a unit hemisphere with a particular FOV cone using the [Shirley-Chiu](https://doi.org/10.1080/10867651.1997.10487479) square to disk mapping. I did this while coding my own [path tracer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing) as part of the _Advanced Computer Graphics_ course at Aalto University.        


### Serato DJ Control Signal Analysis (serato.m)

Investigating and understanding how the [Serato DJ / Scractch Live](https://serato.com/) DJ-software's timecode [control signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinyl_emulation_software) works. More on my [webpage](http://www.esgrove.fi/analysing-the-serato-dj-timecode-signal/).              


### Pi value approximation using Monte Carlo integration (montecarlo_pi.m)

I implemented the classic example of [Monte Carlo integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_integration) for approximating the value of pi for myself when studying Monte Carlo methods.

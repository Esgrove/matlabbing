Various MATLAB scripts I have created over the years.          


### Sobol Hemisphere (sobol_hemisphere.m)

Checking how [Sobol sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobol_sequence) samples map to a unit hemisphere with a particular FOV cone using the [Shirley-Chiu](https://doi.org/10.1080/10867651.1997.10487479) square to disk mapping. I did this while coding my own [path tracer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing) as part of the _Advanced Computer Graphics_ course at Aalto University.
